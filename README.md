# CantorCircles
This project creates a recursive circle design where three sets of points are created on the window. 
They are the left edge, right edge, and origin and I draw a radius between the left edge and origin through a function call. 
This program calls the constructor for each circles recursively for a specified number of depths until the depth hits zero. 
It's like a fractal design.
